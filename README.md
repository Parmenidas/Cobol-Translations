# Cobol-Translations
Tips and tricks for converting code originally written in Cobol.

The examples will convert cobol code into java or kotlin code. Each code focuses on a few aspects of the "translation" process involved.
Ideally, the examplee should be followed in their original order.

It is assumed that you have basic undestanding of java or kotlin and cobol. Most of the explanation focuses on the differences *between* the languages. Thus, you should consider coupling this set of notes with a textbook or online tutorial.
While this is not a step-by-step cobol introduction, it should help clarifying a few aspects of it if you are new. On the other hand,
if you have expertises in cobol, it should help you understanding the main differences with more modern programming paradigms.

Disclaimer: Please notice that the examples are **not** meant to be used in production software. For instance, they often lack a proepr handling of exception/errors. In addition, most legacy cobol software is used to deal with sensitive data, so you should add some security features such as checking the input for buffer overflows.
